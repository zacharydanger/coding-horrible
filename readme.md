#the story so far

Jeff Atwood has been writing less and less relevant posts on http://codinghorror.com for a while now.

This greasemonkey script attempts to correct two things:

1. Remove all backlinking. The average Coding Horror post links back to previous Coding Horror posts. Instead, they're replaced with links to the hilarious webcomic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/).
2. Unbold the random crap Jeff *loves* to make bold for **any old reason whatsoever**.

##disclaimer

This is meant to be humorous. I'm still reading whatever Jeff drops into Google Reader for me.
